# Books I read in 2020-2021


Books on how to live, and live better

- The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer
- The Surrender Experiment by Michael Singer
- Procrastination by Yuen & Burka
- Code of the Extraodinary Mind by Vishen Lakhiani
- Judgement Detox by Gabrielle Berstein

Maybe 8 years ago, I'd find myself frequenting the self-help section of Indigo, which was typically positioned next to the psychology section.  How should I live, and how do I live 'better' than I'm living now?  I've seen this books migrate from self-help, to "business/leadership" as "mindfulness" became a hot-button topic, to now full blow "wellness" sections of the corporate bookstore.
