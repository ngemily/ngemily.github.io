# Why astrology?

My initial interest in astrology stems partly from curiosity of what it is, and
partly because it has such a great historical and cultural impact.  What I found
was that it has much more expressivity than only the 12 signs, which is all I
used to know.  I found that it helped my explore my own personality as well as
come to know personality types that are very different from my own.  This post
aims to give an overview of what I found to be the fundamentals of astrology.

## 4 Elements

The 12 signs can be divided into groups of four elements: _fire_, _earth_,
_air_, and _water_.  Fire signs are all about action.  Earth signs are at home
in the material world.  Air signs live for ideas.  Water signs are in tune with
the psyche.  The way that elements are expressed is through the planets placed
in them, which is discussed later on.  

Fire signs are restless and eager for action.  They are associated with war or
conflict.  Positively expressed, fire signs are assertive; subverted, fire signs
dominate and push out others.  Fire also represents drive, desire and courage.

Earth signs are associated with the material world but not necessarily only in
terms of being materialistic.  They are associated with stability and security.
That's not necessarily only in having the means to survive, but a feeling of
non-scarcity.  One can have material comforts, but still be plagued with a
fear that it might all disappear.  Earth signs are the most easily upset by
disturbances to daily routines.  Earth signs are more predisposed to attaching
sentimental meaning to physical objects.

Air signs are very intellectual.  To air signs, ideas are things in and of
themselves.  There is a high appreciation for aesthetic and beauty, for
elegance.  Air signs can at times feel that the physical and social world are
inconveniences that limit the potential for beauty to be realized.

Water signs are said to be emotional, but I believe intuitive is a better word.
Water signs are more in tune with the psyche and more willing to entertain the
subconscious.  Scorpio, the most stubborn water sign is said to be associated
with the occult.  Cancer, the most leadership driven water sign, is found
heavily in great social leaders.

The identity of the elements  are embedded even in our
language; we speak of the "fire that drives us", being "down to earth", having
our "head in the clouds".  Although astrology is not as prevalent today, the
meaning of the elements is preserved and these are very ancient ideas.

## 3 Cardinalities

The 12 signs can also be divided into the four seasons, with three signs per
season.  In each season, there is a beginning, middle, and end, corresponding
to _cardinal_, _fixed_, and _mutable_.

Cardinal signs start the season.  These signs push forward, starting something
new.  For this reason, they are associated with leadership and initiative.
Although water signs are the more nuanced and adaptable Cancer, the cardinal
water sign, is associated with leadership for the sake of helping others.  While
being in touch with others' needs, Cancer is fully expressed by those who take
action driven by the desire to help others.

As we move into the middle of the season, or fixed signs, everything is a little
more rigid.  The weather is decidedly seasonal.  For example, Leo (Jul 21 - Aug
21) is in the peak of summer.  Weather during this sign is typically exactly how
we think of summer.  These signs are associated with stubbornness.  Just as the
weather is exactly what you would think, the mutable sign is the epitome of its
element.  For example, Taurus, the fixed Earth sign, is as Earthy as it gets;
Taurus is firmly grounded in the material world and steadfast in its resolve.

Finally, we move into the end of the season with mutable signs.  Here,
everything is a bit more malleable.  Sagittarius, the mutable fire sign, is more
open to change and less hot-headed than Aries or Leo.  It reflects also the
changing weather.  Although we mark Sept 21 as the start of fall, the fall
breeze can inevitably be felt throughout Virgo (Aug 21 - Sep 21).


## 4 Elements, 3 cardinalities

If we combine our analyses of elements and cardinalities, we can see that there
is exactly one sign for each combination of element and cardinality.

# What's your sign?

It is commonly believed that everyone has a single sign, which is determined by
the date of birth.  This is not the case.  The sign that most people are
thinking of is the _sun_ sign; that is to say, the sign that the sign was in at
the time of one's birth.  Astrological signs are determined by considering the
Earth in the middle and the planets arranged around the Earth, in various signs.
Each planetary body (including the Sun and the Moon) have their own sign.

Another important sign is the _rising_ sign, also known as the _ascendant_.
This is the sign that was rising over the horizon at the time of birth.  This
sign colours your whole chart.  One may feel a stronger connection to this sign
than one's sun sign.  While the sun sign governs _what_ you are likely to do,
the rising sign governs _how_ you go about doing them.  It governs your general
presence and attitude.  It is the easiest sign to try to guess about someone.

After the sun, and the rising sign, the _moon_ sign says the most.  It governs
the inner self, the self you are as you go to bed and are alone with your
thoughts leaving behind the worries of the day.  It governs how one forms
personal relationships.

There are 5 more personal planets: Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn.
The 3 outer planets: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto move much more slowly than the
inner planets.  They will be in the same sign for a generations at a time and
therefore are less relevant to individual analysis.

|Planet |Area |
| ------ | ---- |
| Mars | Ego assertion and sex drive |
| Venus | Romance and aesthetic |
| Mercury | Analysis and communication |
| Jupiter | Luck and public persona | 
| Saturn | Responsibility |
| Uranus | Social justice and revolution |
| Neptune | Psyche |
| Pluto | Death and rebirth |

Traditionally, Aries is the first sign (not Aquarius which is the sign that
comes first in calendar year).  Each sign is associated with a planet; we say
that the planet rules the sign, or that the sign is the planets domicile.  The
sign opposite the domicile is its detriment (opposite means across from on the
wheel, i.e. Aries's opposite is Libra).  Whether a planet is in its domicile or
detriment will affect how easily its energies can be expressed.  In general, a
planet in its domicile is more easily expressed and a planet in its detriment is
expressed with more difficulty.  For example, with Mars in Libra it is more
difficult to express its charge ahead nature while being influenced by the
subtle and fair aesthetic of Libra.

The planets are traditionally ordered: Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and
Saturn, **not** as they are ordered in the solar system.  This is also the
reasoning behind Gustav Holsts's composition _The Planets_.  Starting from Leo
and Cancer, which are ruled by the sun and the moon respectively, then going
outwards the planets match the order in the solar system.  The outer planets:
Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto were added later and are considered to share
rulership.  Thus, now starting from Aries and going counter clock-wise we get
the astrological order of the planets.

# The structure of astrology

The art of interpretation is taking all the pieces of information together and
making sense of it as a whole.  Primarily, this entails looking at what planets
are in which signs and houses, what aspects they make to each other, and to
look at overall patterns and imbalances.  For example, charts may be heavily
biased to a particular element or lack a particular element.  In my experience,
it is important to address imbalances and somehow bring the energy of missing
elements into ones life.

Together, the planets, signs, house positions, and aspects determine the natural
tendencies in one's life.  I believe that astrology is a useful roadmap for self
exploration and bringing to our awareness tendencies that we might take for
granted.  Things may be written in the stars, but they're not set in stone.

This post gives only a cursory introduction to astrology, and I may very well
have made errors in my understanding and explanation.  I have made no discussion
on aspects or houses, but the interested reader is encouraged to find more
reading.  My hope is that I may have expanded your view of astrology.  Thank you
for reading.
