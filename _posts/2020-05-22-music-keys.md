# Introduction

In this post, I dive into some introductory music theory and how to find the
keys for each scale on the piano using that theoretical background.  Having been
interested in classical music and piano but no formal training, I set about
exploring the topic with the help of books and the internet.

# Diatonic scale

Western classical music is written in the diatonic scale, that is a seven-note
scale with the following tone (T)/semi-tone (S) step pattern:

> T-T-S-T-T-T-S

An example that most of us have probably seen in Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do.

# Finding the keys

The modern piano is designed around the diatonic scale.  If we look at an
octave's span of keys,

We see that the keyboard is comprised of white and black keys, with the black
keys situated between white keys and clustered in groups of two and three.  We
see that the keys are arranged in white (W) and black (B) in the following
fashion:

> W-B-W-B-W-W-B-W-B-W-B-W


_The space (in pitch) between each key is a semitone._

I was amazed to learn that the space between each white key is not equal--that
in fact, the space between two white keys may be either a whole tone or a
semi-tone.  With my lack of music background, my first assumption was that all
white keys must be equally spaced and the black keys must be in-between pitches.

Therefore, the space between each white key is

> T-T-S-T-T-T-S

which is exactly our diatonic scale.

The white keys are labeled

> C-D-E-F-G-A-B

which comprise the C-major scale.  Thus, we can play the C-major scale by
finding C (left of pair of black keys) and playing all the white keys.

Including the black keys, they are labeled:

> C-C#-D-E♭-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-B♭-B

Here, `#` denotes "sharp" where _X#_ is a half step higher than _X_ and `♭`
denotes "flat" where _X♭_ is a half step lower than X.  Note that F# may be
equivalently labeled G♭, but we have F# as the conventional label.

We will see that this grouping will let us easily pick out the keys in each
scale.

# Forming the major scales

C-major:

> T-T-S-T-T-T-S
>
> C-D-E-F-G-A-B

G-major:
> G-A-B-C-D-E-F
