In this post, the times used will refer to the time in the track, not the time
in the movie

## Ancient Sorcerer's Secret

This song plays during the first battle scene between the Ancient One and
Kaecilius.

The main motif, which I'll call the Kamar Taj motif, is first heard at 0:27.  It
introduces the motif with its iconic lone horn sound, with also a brief twang on
the sitar.  The sitar becomes a key instrument later on in the film.

The motif is heard again at 1:27, in full this time.

At 2:18, what I call the Strange motif is heard for the first time.  That's the
motif that plays when the cloak of levitation first comes to Strange.  I noted
that it comes after the battle has concluded, as the Ancient One steps through
the portal.

## Hands Dealt

This song starts playing as Stephen begins reviewing the scans of his hands.  At
the next scene, we see Stephen from through the window.  Christine helps him
shave as he is unable to do it himself.

At 2:08, one might expect the same melody of the song to continue, but instead
we hear the Kamar Taj motif.  It appears slow, and sad, but it's there.  Its
most pronounced feature is the horn where previously the track was entirely
piano and strings.  Lining it up with the film, it is at this moment that
Strange is first told about the Pangborn (who was paralyzed but learned to walk
again after studying at Kamar Taj).

## Mystering training

At this song, Strange is beginning his studies with the Ancient One.  The theme
appears at 0:13, but less developed and with a softer instrument than the main
horn.  It's something of the musical equivalent of a training montage.  At this
time, Strange is coming into his powers but is still weak.

We hear the iconic horn at 0:58, but much slower than normal.

## Inside the Mirror Dimension

At this song, Strange has become more accomplished, but his is still not wise.
We hear a couple of notes on the horn.

## Sanctimonious Sanctum Sacking

This song plays during Strange's first encounter with Kaecilius.

At 6:32 the Strange theme plays.  This is the climax of the soundtrack, and
appears roughly in the middle.  The theme is not heard again to such a full
degree for the rest of the film.  In the film this is when Strange, after
falling over the balcony, levitates back to meet Kaicilius.  This is the first
time we see him in full costume, wearing both the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak
of Levitation.  Strange has come into his full power.

At this track, we switch from hearing the Kamar Taj theme more frequently to the
Strange theme.

## Post Op Paracosm

Heavy use of harpsichord and piano.  The piano is linked with New York and
Western society, as well as Christine.

## Hippocratic Hypocrite

This track is very much like Hands Dealt, but the lower register of piano is
replaced with the harpsichord.  Much as Strange was presented with a crossroads
when is hands were damaged during Hands Dealt, this song is about the Ancient
One and her choices.

## Smote and Mirrors

This track brings us back to the first track and the first battle between the
Ancient One and Kaecilius.

In the first half I believe we hear the Strange theme a couple of times, while
on screen Strange is running from Kaecilius and the Zealots in the mirror
dimension.

Later, the Ancient One joins the fight.  At 4:55 and 5:30 we hear the Kamar Taj
theme quite intensely as on screen the Ancient One is using her full power.

## Ancient History

In this track the Ancient One is dying.  She is also revealing to Stephen the
lesson that he still hasn't mastered, that "fear an arrogance still prevent him
from learning the most significant lesson."  We hear a blend of sitar and piano.
The Ancient One brings the Eastern sitar to New York's Wester piano.  The
Ancient One is also in a way transferring her responsibilities to Stephen, should
he choose that path.

## Strange Days Ahead

This track summarizes all the music in the film.  It blends many of the
instruments and motifs together.  Strange assumes the motifs of Kamar Taj and
the Ancient One, but with a cool laid back attitude.

Strange puts his watch back on.  It's the one piece of his clothing/costume from
his past life.  When he arrived at Kamar Taj he took it off.  In away that was
time suspended; he had not yet decided how to move forward.  In his last
conversation with the Ancient One he considers the possibility of returning to
his old life.  In this scene he firmly decides to remain the protector of the
Sanctum, and so as he puts on the watch, his life resumes.

# A note on the motifs

I call the first motif the "Kamar Taj" motif.  It starts high, then goes low
with a successive three notes that increase.  It has a very epic, heavy quality
to it.  Everybody comes to Kamar Taj broken, fallen from some higher point.
Kamar Taj is a place of healing, strengthening.  It follows then, that it starts
high, falls low, and rebuilds.

I call the second motif the "Strange" motif.  To me, this motif is Strange's
story of how he put himself back together.  The theme starts low and generally
builds up.  Strange shows up at Kamar Taj at rock bottom, and builds himself up
again.

These are very simple interpretations of the two motifs, but they resonate with
me.
