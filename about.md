This blog is a place where I write about things that interest me, particularly
any original thoughts or perspectives that I have.

I am a software engineer and avid Vim user.  I am passionate about tools and
productivity.  To me, productivity is reducing the amount of effort to the
essential components and productivity tools compute the things that can be
computed so that people don't have to.
